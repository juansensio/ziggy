# The Game of Life

Zig implementation of the [Game of Life](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life).

- [x] Basic implementation: lots of loops, lots of if-else statements
- [x] Functions (but still with pre-defined grid size)
- [x] Allocator (so we can use dynamic grid size, required for testing)
- [x] Testing
- [x] Structs (so we can simplify the code, memory allocation and assignments)
- [ ] Benchmarking (add benchamrk to build so can import from other scripts)
- [ ] Vectorized implementation
- [ ] Parallelization
- [ ] sparse matrix multiplication
